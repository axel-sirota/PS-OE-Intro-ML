# PS-OE-Intro-ML

This is a 2-day Intro ML course focused on the basics of ML, terminology, a lot of hands-on, etc. No real math to speak of, and very little about data clean(s)ing.

We are moving towards not having materials in GitHub, but rather, keeping the in the cloud via Google Slides.

Current presentation is at the link belowâ€“please make your own copy of it:

There are currently some slides which are skipped as there is too much material so it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the deck as much as possible, and feel free to pick and choose what you'll cover. We intend to edit the deck shortly to make it clearer which materials are optional and possibly not covered.
